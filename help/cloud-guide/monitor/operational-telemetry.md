# Operational Telemetry service

The Operational Telemetry service monitors the client-side traffic on a website or an application in real-time. The service focuses on collecting metrics and data that are key to optimize performance by monitoring website engagements, rather than the users themselves. With Operational Telemetry, key performance metrics are tracked right from the initiation of the URL until the request is served back to the browser.

## Implementation details

The service is currently being rolled out to select Adobe Commerce sites.

## Access and management

Customers who want to access Operational Telemetry data or disable the service must contact Adobe Support.
